Q2 List the difference between First() and FirstOrDefault() operator.

   The First() method returns the first element of a collection, or the first element that satisfies the specified condition using lambda    
   expression or Func delegate.If a given collection is empty or does not include any element that satisfied the condition then it will      
   throw InvalidOperation exception.

	Returns the first element of a sequence, or a default value if no element is found.
	Throws exception only if the source is null.
	Good to use when more than 1 element is expected and you want only the first. Also it is ok for the result to be empty.
